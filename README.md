*Star Force Wars*

## Project Overview
*GUC, Winter 2017, DMET502*

This is a 2D catch/reach-destination game implemented using OpenGL C++ library. The main game idea is that a spaceship starts at the middle of the screen and keeps moving forward. This is done by moving the background while the object stays in place. The spaceship can move upwards or downwards along the path while avoiding the obstacles and taking in power-ups. The spaceship tries to catch power-ups to reach a destination, and avoids obstacles to not get pushed back.
